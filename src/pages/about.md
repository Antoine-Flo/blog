Hey! I'm Antoine, a french backend developer transitioning to cloud engineering.

Based in Lyon, I've spent 3 years building APIs and backend systems with Node.js/TypeScript. Now I'm diving deep into cloud infrastructure - AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform - preparing for my next chapter as a DevOps Engineer.

I love automating things, experimenting with new tech, and making systems more robust. When I'm not coding, you'll find me traveling, listening to music, developing games, or advocating for a free and accessible internet.

Always curious, always learning. 

Feel free to reach out. Cheers!
