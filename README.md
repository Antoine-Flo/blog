The `themes` option in `site.config.ts` allows you to define interactive and dynamic themes for your site. Themes are defined as objects with properties like `name`, `colors`, and `fonts`. Here's an example:

```ts
export const themes = [
  {
     name: "Cotton Candy",
     colors: {
        background: "#ffebf0",
        text: "#6b4e71",
        accent: "#ff6f91",
     },
  },
  {
     name: "Mint Chocolate",
     colors: {
        background: "#2e3b3e",
        text: "#d9e7e2",
        accent: "#8abf69",
     },
  },
];
```

Visitors can switch between themes dynamically, making your site more engaging and delightful!
